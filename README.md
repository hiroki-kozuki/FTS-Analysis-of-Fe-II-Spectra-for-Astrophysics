# FTS-Analysis-of-Fe-II-Spectra-for-Astrophysics
### Research Project for Imperial College London's Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme. 
### Aiming to confirm new energy levels of Fe II.
#### Analysing laboratory spectra obstained using a Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) and matching results to the observed spectra from the HR 6000 star.
